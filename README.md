# CustomDraggableSquareView
Custom view that draws square shapes when view is touched. Slider to increase/decrease the square size.
Coordinates of squares are preserved even when app is closed and coordinates data can be viewed as list.
Uses Paper.db to store the data instead of SharedPreferences thus avoiding delays related to data serialization/deserialization.
